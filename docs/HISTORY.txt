Changelog
=========

0.3 - 2009-04-08
----------------

* Use collective.monkeypatcher to move all patches into ZCML

* Fully deprecate the Zope exception handler in favor of the logging
  hook since the Zope exception handler uses the logging module
  anyways and more can be done by hooking at that level.

* Handle failed matches in Products.PDBDebugMode.pdblogging more
  gracefully

* More flexible log matching.  Change
  Products.PDBDebugMode.pdblogging.ignore_regexes to ignore_matchers
  and accept any callable.

----------------

* Eggified

0.1 - 2006-03-11
----------------

* Initial release
